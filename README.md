# Forecasting_LSTM

This program performs time series forecasting using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model on a simulated univariate dataset. 
It applies a supervised learning approach by transforming the time series into input-output pairs based on a specified window size. 
The model is trained to predict the next value in the sequence, making it a one-step-ahead forecast. This setup is particularly 
useful for capturing temporal dependencies and trends within the data. The simulation allows for controlled experimentation and 
evaluation of the LSTMâ€™s ability to learn and generalize from sequential patterns in univariate time series forecasting tasks.

# Synthetic Time Series Data Generator
The file generar_series_temporales.py defines a Python class for generating synthetic time series data for meteorological variables: 
atmospheric pressure, temperature, and wind speed. 

The generator creates realistic data by mimicking daily and yearly cycles, adding trends, and incorporating random noise.
